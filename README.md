# ContentBlocksButton

**THIS PROJECT IS ANTIQUATED**

The best way to add a button input type to ContentBlocks:

- Add a new field of type `link`
- Add a setting to the field of type text
  - Change the `Expose Field` value to `Expose field on canvas as a regular field`
- Job done, you have a link input with a text input that can be used for the label
